# Discord Bot With AI Embeddings

Running this application with all dependencies set (incl. enviromental variables, Supabase, Discord) will log in to discord and answer any question with relevant match that is reacted to with "ðŸ¤–" during the set window.

The bot will convert the query to a standalone question, which will be converted to vector embeddings and tested against the database. In the current configuration, only the nearest match will be returned. Both, the original query and the database context is sent to ChatGPT's default model. An answer will be pasted to Discord as a message reply.
